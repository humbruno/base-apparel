### What I learned

This project highlighted a few gaps in my knowledge when working with images and switching before different ones depending on the viewport.

Nevertheless, it was very helpful to explore various approches to switching between them and find out which one works best for each project.

The JavaScript email validation, albeit simple, was great practice into doing research about topics I may not be completely familar with, which I believe to be an essential skill to any developer.
